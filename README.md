These are the solutions for [The Odin Project - Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion#project-solution) using JavaScript.

## Task 1 - Fibonacci

In the `Task 1` folder, you'll find a file named `index.js`. It contains functions to find Fibonacci members/numbers.

- `fibs(number)`: Iterative solution for finding Fibonacci numbers.
- `fibsRec(number)`: Recursive solutions for finding Fibonacci numbers (two alternatives are provided).

## Task 2 - Merge Sort

In the `Task 2` folder, you'll find a file named `index.js`. It contains a function for performing Merge Sort.

## Run Projects

To run the project, you need `Node JS` inside your machine.
The following is how to run it.

```sh
    node [file-path]
```

> > > Another way to run the script, you can simply use the Browser Developer Tools by adding `index.html` at the main folder and link the script.
